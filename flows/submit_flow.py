shout.submit with SequentialTaskRunner - runs immediately using the SequentialTaskRunner
(useful when you want a PrefectFuture to get at the state from a task)

You can also mix within a flow ie: have some tasks without submit() to execute immediately and locally, and
others that run via the task runner.
