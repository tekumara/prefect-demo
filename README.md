# Orion Demo

Prefect Orion examples running self-contained in a local kubernetes cluster. Batteries (mostly) included. 🔋

## Getting started

Prerequisites:

- make
- node (required for pyright)
- python >= 3.9
- docker & docker compose
- [k3d](https://k3d.io/) (for creating a local kubernetes cluster)
- kubectl

To start:

- Install the [development environment](CONTRIBUTING.md#Development-environment): `make install`

## Examples

Flows

- [Dask flow](flows/dask_flow.py) using a dask local cluster
- [Dask kubes flow](flows/dask_kubes_flow.py) using an ephemeral dask cluster on Kubernetes
- [Parameterized flow](flows/param_flow.py) using a custom Docker image containing additional modules
- [Ray flow](flows/ray_flow.py) that runs on an existing ray cluster (see [tekumara/ray-demo](https://github.com/tekumara/ray-demo))
- [Sub flow](flows/sub_flow.py) that is trigger by a parent flow
- [Submit flow](flows/submit.py) demonstrates the difference of running tasks with/without `.submit()`

[Deployments](flows/kubes_deployments.py) to Kubernetes using

- the default OrionPackager to store the flow source in Orion
- the default OrionPackager to store the flow import path in Orion
- the FilePackager to store the flow source in S3 (minio)

## Usage

### Local

1. `make param-flow` or `make dask-flow` or `make ray-flow` or `make sub-flow`
1. `make ui` then navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)

The orion sqlite database is stored in _~/.prefect/orion.db_

### Kubernetes

Create k3d cluster with an image registry, minio (for remote storage), the prefect agent and api

```
make kubes
```

Create kubes deployments and run them

```
make kubes-deploy
```

### UI

Prefect UI: [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)

Minio UI: [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001). User: `minioadmin` pass: `minioadmin`.

### API

Prefect API: [http://localhost:4200/api/](http://localhost:4200/api/)

## Docs

- [Blocks](blocks.md) - an overview and look into the database tables for Blocks.

## References

- [Orion tutorials](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/tutorials/first-steps/) from which some of the examples are taken

## Cloud

To run flows with a cloud workspace set:

```
export PREFECT_API_URL=https://api-beta.prefect.io/api/accounts/$accountid/workspaces/$workspaceid
export PREFECT_API_KEY=<your api key>
```

`$accountid` and `$workspaceid` are visible in the URL when you login to Prefect Cloud. The api key can be created from your user profile (bottom left).

Setting the environment variables is recommended. An alternative method is to login using:

```
prefect cloud login --key <your api key>
```

However be aware that this stores your api url and key as plain text _~/.prefect/profiles.toml_.

## Known issues

- [Add mapping (.map() operator) #5582](https://githgsub.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/issues/5582)
- [Flow run parameters cannot be set in the UI #5617](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/issues/5617)
- [Logs configured in tasks with get_run_logger using DaskTaskRunner don't make it to the Prefect 2.0 backend #5850](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/issues/5850)
- [Ray task runner logs missing #25](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-ray/issues/25)
- [FileNotFoundError errors when running with a remote ray cluster #26](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-ray/issues/26)

## Caveats

The Deployment defines a flow name and the flow code. It's possible to have two Deployments with different flow code but the same flow name.

Packagers only package the flow's source file, and not any modules it may reference. Referenced modules will need to be baked into the docker image.

## Troubleshooting

### Flows are late

Check the logs of the agent:

```
make kube-logs
```

If you see `prefect.agent - No work queue found named 'kubernetes'` the work queue is missing. It can get lost when orion is restarted.

Recreate the work queue:

```
make kube-work-queue
```

And then your flows should start.

## Todo

- [Deployment yaml](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/concepts/deployments/#deployment-object) example
- Use service account in Kubes
